The game of words

Poetry is the art of uniting pleasure with truth, 
and this art one of humanitites most cherished skills. 
here we have done a small effot to mimic this skill in humans, by using a stochastic technique called MArkov Process.

Markov Property

Markov property is defined by the following condition: 
(26)Pr(X(t+1)=j|X(0)=i0,X(1)=i1,…,X(t)=i)=Pr(X(t+1)=j|X(t)=i)In other words,
(26) represents a situation that the state X at time t + 1 only depends on the one preceding state X at time t, 
and it is independent from the past states X(t−1), …, X(1).
